# URM - Untitled Ravenfield Minimap Mod

A minimap system for Ravenfield that integrates with the game's existing minimap functionality.

## Features

- Shows a minimap in the corner of the screen
- Rotates with player view direction
- Shows flag/capture point locations with team colors
- Shows resupply crate locations
- Toggle the minimap with the 'M' key (configurable)
- Compatible with Ravenfield's existing minimap system

## Installation

1. Place the mod files in your Ravenfield mods folder
2. Start the game and enable the mod

## Configuration

The minimap can be configured in-game through the mod settings menu:

- **Enable Minimap**: Toggle the minimap on/off
- **Rotate With Player**: Whether the minimap rotates with player view
- **Show Flags**: Show capture points on the minimap
- **Show Resupply Crates**: Show resupply crates on the minimap
- **Use Team Colors**: Use team colors for the minimap UI
- **Minimap Scale**: Adjust the size of the minimap

## How It Works

This mod taps into the existing Ravenfield minimap system to show a tactical overview of the battlefield. It uses the same camera and rendering system as the game's full-screen map, but displayed in a corner of the screen for convenience.

## Compatibility

The mod is designed to be compatible with most other Ravenfield mods and should work with all game versions that include the minimap system.

## License

This mod is free to use and modify for personal use.
